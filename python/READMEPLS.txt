Hello!

This is a python script for rolling 2 6-sided dice and getting 2 randomly generated results.
It is based on the "Random" module in Python.

To run, download the python file and open powershell and type and cd to the script location.
From there, run by typing "python .\DiceRoll.py" and hit enter. It will automatically 'roll' 2
dice and then print the results and ask if you want to roll again. Type either "y" or "yes"
to roll again. If anything other than this is entered, the script breaks and ends.
